# Maritime Vessel Safety Systems Automated Verification & Validation (V&V) Framework

## Overview
This project involves developing an enhanced automated V&V framework for maritime safety systems, focusing on regulatory compliance, safety reliability, and efficient validation processes.

## Deliverables Achieved
- **Requirements Traceability Matrix:** Structured decomposition of IMO SOLAS and Transport Canada guidelines.
- **Automated Testing Framework:** Robust Python scripts utilizing pytest for Fire Detection, Emergency Shutdown, and Bilge Alarm systems.
- **Simulation Environment:** MATLAB/Simulink simulations integrated with Python interfaces for comprehensive system validation.

## Additional Components (In Development)
### Additional Test Cases
- **Interface:** Central alarm and automation system tests.
- **Maintenance:** Self-diagnostics, fail-safe mechanisms, manual override, periodic checks.
- **Common Systems:** Fault monitoring, event logging, response timing, operation confirmations.

### Simulator Enhancements
- Advanced interfaces for alarm and automation systems.
- Improved diagnostic capabilities and real-time event logging.

### Configuration Management Integration
- Full integration with Jira-based CMDB.
- Automated version control and configuration tracking.

### Compliance Documentation Automation
- Standardized reporting templates (IMO SOLAS, Transport Canada).
- Automated extraction and reporting of test results.
